# Sundae-Shop-Stock-Management-System
A java based desktop application to manage stocks of a sundae shop for a period of 24 hours.

The Sundae Shop helps the user to store each entry on sale of an ice-cream. Also it will print the bill of the choosen ice-cream with all the specifications and cost including the tax. It also stores all the sold ice-creams in a table with all the specifications and one can also print that table at the end of the application.

This Sundae Shop project will help small scale vendors who still have to managed their stocks manually by storing specific information of a sundae at the ease of fingertips. It initially starts with a LOGIN PAGE where entering necessary credentials one can login through and jump on to the WELCOME PAGE where you will find the name of the shop and the menu. Now the coming page is the soul of the project call ORDERING PAGE where you will find various things you can do in the application like ordering a sundae, modifying a previous sundae and printing all the sundae sold so far. 

This application can further be converted in full-time restuarant application.

Concatenating the src files along with other necessay files one can get hand-on with this project and can further build by their choice.
